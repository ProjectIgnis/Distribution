Note that system hotkeys may intercept some of the above keyboard shortcuts.
The following app shortcuts are also available in the app and dock menus:

* Cmd+Q quits the game
* Ctrl+Cmd+F toggles fullscreen

## Deck editor search functions
* `string`:
	returns all cards that have `string` in their name OR in the card text.
	Example: `Hero`
* `@string`
	returns all cards that belong to the `string` archetype. If no string is provided, returns all cards that are part of any archetype.
	Example: `@Hero`
* `$string`
	returns all cards that have `string` in their name only, which ignores the card text.
	Example: `$Heroic`
* `!!string`:
	negative lookup (NOT)
* `string1*string2`
	replaces any character in any amount. Example: `Eyes*Dragon` will return cards Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Red-Eyes B. Dragon, Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, etc.
* `string1||string2`
	returns all cards that have `string1` OR `string2` in their name/text. Any of the strings can have any of the modifiers above.
	Example: `Trickstar||Bounzer`
* `string1`&&`string2`
	returns all cards that match `string1` and `string2`. Any of the strings can have any of the modifiers above.

These can be combined. Example: `@blue-eyes||$eyes of blue` returns all cards that belong to either the `Blue-Eyes` archetype or have `Eyes of Blue` in their names.

The ATK, DEF, Level/Rank, and Scale textboxes support searching for `?`. You can also prefix the search with comparison modifiers <, <=, >=, >, and =. 

## Test hand
A Hand Test mode is accessible from the deck editor, with quick restart.
The duel will **never** end normally in this game mode (e.g. running out of LP, decking out)
* Notice that this mode was not made to control the opponent. Dueling vs yourself in LAN Mode would be a better option for that.

## Discord Rich Presence
Works with the desktop version of Discord. In your Discord settings, turn on Game Activity first.

Your status on Discord will update to be playing a game, including elapsed time.
Activities displayed in Rich Presence:
* Dueling
* In menu
* Playing a puzzle
* Watching a replay
* Editing a deck

### Game invites
Host a room on a server (LAN does not work). In the appropriate channel or private message, the upload (+) icon should change to have an additional green play button.
Clicking on it will send out a game invite to your room with your message of choice. If the room is locked, the password will be skipped for invitees.
Users can accept the invite while EDOPro is closed if they've started it once before; the game should be launched automatically. Note that Discord is rather fickle and changes this behaviour on us very frequently, so if the game fails to automatically launch, try starting the game.

## Customization

### Default textures:
See README in `textures`.

### Skins:
Editable by adding subfolders to **skin**. For each folder, provide a unique `skin.xml` file, with the changes you want.
You can switch skins in the settings (CTRL+O). For instructions on the supported fields and what they change, see README in `skin`.

### Audio:
See README in `sound`. There are many new features, including summon chants!
Music and sound volume controls are also separated.

### MSAA (antialiasing)
Makes sharp/pixelated edges softer, but requires more performance.
2D elements might look blurred at higher levels. Rendering results are hardware- and device-dependent.
The program will automatically try smaller MSAA values if the driver does not support the specified MSAA level.

## Advanced configuration

### system.conf
`config/system.conf` handles most of the configurations available in the game. It is overwritten when the game is closed normally.
Only options not directly configurable in-game are listed here.
Configurations listed as "boolean" accept either 0 for 'disabled' or 1 for 'enabled'.

| Name     | Purpose | Example |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| driver_type  | graphic driver used for rendering. Valid values are: opengl, d3d9, d3d9on12, ogles1, ogles2, default. The availability of those values is listed in the table below.  | |
| useWayland  | Linux only. 1 = use experimental wayland device; 0 = use x11 device. | |
| textfont | path to the font used for texts and its size | fonts/NotoSansJP-Regular.otf 12 |
| numfont  | path to the font used for numbers            | fonts/NotoSansJP-Regular.otf |
| fallbackFonts  | path to the fonts to be used as fallback for missing characters (each font and its **must** be contained in double quotes `"`, the game ships with a `bundled` font that will always be loaded) | "fonts/fallback1.otf 15" "bundled 12" |

If a character cannot be found in the supplied font, it will not be displayed. The shipped font supports all characters that appear on Yu-Gi-Oh! cards in Latin alphabets and Japanese.

### supported values for driver_type based on the system
|      | opengl | d3d9 | d3d9on12 | ogles1 | ogles2 | default |
| -------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Windows  | X | X | X (If supported by the driver) | X (If supported by the driver) | X (If supported by the driver) | d3d9 |
| Linux Wayland  | X (Only if LibGLx is present) | | | X (only if libGLESv1_CM is present) | X | ogles2 |
| Linux X11 | X | | | X (only if libGLESv1_CM is present) | X (only if libGLESv2 is present) | opengl |
| MacOS | X | | | | | opengl |
| Android | | | | X | X | ogles2 |

### configs.json
